# Matrix Operator Console

Welcome, Neo. You've jacked into the Matrix Operator Console, a fully interactive, themeable chatbot and developer toolkit inspired by the world of *The Matrix*. This isn't just a command line; it's a connection to the Oracle, the Architect, and the core systems that run the simulation.

Ask questions, generate code, summarize web pages, and access a suite of developer utilities, all from a retro-themed terminal interface.

## Command Showcase (How to Use)

Here are a few examples of the core commands in action.

#### 1. Asking the Oracle
Use the `ask()` command for general-purpose questions. The AI will respond in the persona of the Oracle.

```
ask("Is choice an illusion?")
```


#### 2. Generating Code
Use `generate_code()` to get functional code snippets from the Architect.

```
generate_code(lang:"python", task:"a function to find prime numbers")
```


#### 3. Summarizing a Web Page
Use `find_exit()` to get a quick, thematic summary of any article.

```
find_exit(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation)
```


#### 4. Changing the Theme
Use `set_theme()` to switch between different visual styles.

```
set_theme(amber)
```

## Features

This console is powered by a Node.js & Express backend connected to the blazing-fast Groq API, with a vanilla JavaScript frontend to keep things lightweight and responsive.

### üß† AI-Powered Commands
*   **`ask("your question")`**: Connect directly to the Oracle for wise, enigmatic, and sometimes cryptic answers to any question.
*   **`generate_code(lang:"...", task:"...")`**: Access the Architect's toolbox to generate functional code snippets in any programming language.
*   **`find_exit(URL)`**: Provide a URL to an article or website, and the operator will trace its core meaning, providing a concise summary.

### üõ†Ô∏è Operator Utilities
*   **`fabricate_data(...)`**: Generate structured mock data in JSON format using a simple schema.
*   **`generate_key(...)`**: Create cryptographically strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets.
